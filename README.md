# **Caesar Cipher Implementation - JAVA**
https://github.com/Iman24474/Cryptography/tree/main/shiftcipher  
**Overview:**  
This program is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

**Features:**  
Encryption: The program takes a plaintext message and a specified shift value, and it encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
Decryption: In addition to encryption, the program can also decrypt a Caesar Cipher encrypted message if provided with the correct shift value.    

# **Extended Euclidean Algorithm - JAVA**  
https://github.com/Iman24474/Cryptography/tree/main/ExtendedEuclideanAlgorithm  
**Overview:**  
This Java implementation provides the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, a fundamental algorithm in number theory for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and their BÃ©zout coefficients. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is particularly useful in solving linear Diophantine equations and modular inverses.
