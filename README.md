# **Caesar Cipher Implementation - JAVA**
https://github.com/Iman24474/Cryptography/tree/main/shiftcipher  
  **Overview:**  
This program is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

**Features:**  
Encryption: The program takes a plaintext message and a specified shift value, and it encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
Decryption: In addition to encryption, the program can also decrypt a Caesar Cipher encrypted message if provided with the correct shift value.    

# **Extended Euclidean Algorithm - JAVA**  
https://github.com/Iman24474/Cryptography/tree/main/ExtendedEuclideanAlgorithm  
**Overview:**  
This Java implementation provides the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, a fundamental algorithm in number theory for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and their Bézout coefficients. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is particularly useful in solving linear Diophantine equations and modular inverses. 
  
**Features:**  
GCD: The greatest common divisor of the input integers.  
Coefficient S: Bézout coefficient for the first integer.  
Coefficient T: Bézout coefficient for the second integer.  
Table: A Table with detailed steps on how the extended Euclidean algorithm proceeds for its given inputs.
