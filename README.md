# **Caesar Cipher Implementation - JAVA**
https://github.com/Iman24474/Cryptography/tree/main/shiftcipher  
**Overview:**  
This program is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

**Features:**  
Encryption: The program takes a plaintext message and a specified shift value, and it encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
Decryption: In addition to encryption, the program can also decrypt a Caesar Cipher encrypted message if provided with the correct shift value.
